# The Basics

WebAssembly wouldn't exist if it wasn't fundamentally different from JavaScript, ultimately enabling entirely new use cases on the web. Likewise, AssemblyScript is much more similar to a static compiler than it is to a JavaScript VM. One can think of it as if TypeScript and C had a somewhat special child. It's not exactly TypeScript, not exactly C, yet it is destined to inherit the best of both.

## Strictness

Unlike TypeScript, which targets a JavaScript environment with all of its dynamic features, AssemblyScript targets WebAssembly, and intentionally **avoids the dynamicness of JavaScript** where it cannot be compiled ahead of time _efficiently_.

Limiting ourselves to where WebAssembly excels, for example by assigning or inferring definite types, eliminates the need to ship-a-JIT doing the heavy lifting at runtime, yielding **predictable performance** right from the start of execution while guaranteeing that the resulting WebAssembly **modules are small**.

## Static typing

The first thing one is going to notice when writing AssemblyScript is that its [type system](types.md) differs from TypeScript's in that it uses WebAssembly's **more specific integer and floating point types**, with JavaScript's `number` merely an alias of WebAssembly's `f64`.

A JavaScript JIT would try to figure out the best representation of a numeric value while the code is executing, making assumptions as values flow around, potentially recompiling code multiple times, while AssemblyScript lets the developer **specify the ideal type in advance** with all its pros and cons. To give a few examples:

### No any or undefined

{% code title="" %}
```typescript
// ðŸ˜¢
function foo(a?) {
  var b = a + 1
  return b
}

// ðŸ˜Š
function foo(a: i32 = 0): i32 {
  var b = a + 1
  return b
}
```
{% endcode %}

### No union types

{% code title="" %}
```typescript
// ðŸ˜¢
function foo(a: i32 | string): void {
}

// ðŸ˜Š
function foo<T>(a: T): void {
}
```
{% endcode %}

### Strictly typed objects

{% code title="" %}
```typescript
// ðŸ˜¢
var a = {}
a.prop = "hello world"

// ðŸ˜Š
var a = new Map<string,string>()
a.set("prop", "hello world")

// ðŸ˜Š
class A {
  constructor(public prop: string) {}
}
var a = new A("hello world")
```
{% endcode %}

## Sandbox

WebAssembly modules execute in a sandbox, providing **strong security guarantees** for all sorts of use cases not necessarily limited to the browser. As such, a module has **no immediate access to the DOM** or other JavaScript APIs out of the box, making it necessary to translate and exchange data either through the module's [exports and imports](exports-and-imports.md) operating on basic numeric values or reading from respectively writing to the module's linear memory.

## Bleeding edge

At the current state, WebAssembly supports **basic numeric types** like integers and floats, and one can think of objects as being a clever composition of basic values in linear memory. Consequently, whole **objects cannot yet flow in and out of WebAssembly** natively, making it necessary to translate between their representation in WebAssembly memory and JavaScript objects.

This is typically the first real bummer one is going to run into. For now, there is [the loader](loader.md) that provides the utility necessary to exchange strings and arrays for example, but it's somewhat edgy on its own due to its garbage collection primitives. It's a great starting point however for learning more about how our higher level structures _actually_ work.

## Diverging semantics

Overall, there are a few differences that make it **unlikely that existing TypeScript code can be compiled** to WebAssembly without modifications, yet likely that already **reasonably strict TypeScript code can be made compatible** with the AssemblyScript compiler.

One prominent and admittedly controversial example of a semantic difference is that `===` is used for identity comparisons \(the exact same object\) since its special JavaScript semantics \(same value and same type\) are irrelevant in a strict type context.

```typescript
var s1 = "1"
var s2 = "123".substring(0, 1)
s1 === s1 // true
s1 === s2 // false
s2 === s2 // true
s1 === 1 // compile error
s1 == s2 // true
```

For all other types than `string` and operator-overloaded objects with a `==` overload, `===` is equivalent to `==`. This is likely to change once we figure out a better alternative.
