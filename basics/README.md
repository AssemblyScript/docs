# The Basics

Unlike TypeScript, which targets a JavaScript environment with all of its dynamic features, AssemblyScript targets WebAssembly, intentionally avoiding the dynamicness of JavaScript where it cannot be compiled ahead of time _efficiently_.

WebAssembly's [type system](types.md) differs from JavaScript's in that it has more specific integer \(`i32` and `i64`\) and floating point \(`f32` and `f64`\) types, yet it has no higher level concept of strings or classes on its own. However, as usually in computer science, higher level functionality can be implemented with just these, and [the loader](loader.md) provides the necessary utility to work with higher-level structures externally. One can think of AssemblyScript as if C and JavaScript had a somewhat special child that tries to be more like the one or the other depending on circumstances.

At this point in time, it must also be noted that WebAssembly runs in a sandbox with no immediate access to the DOM or other JavaScript APIs. Basic parts of the [environment](environment.md) can be implemented on the [standard library](../details/standard-library/) side, while other parts need to be imported from the host, sometimes requiring a bit of JavaScript glue code to translate between objects and numbers.

Combined, this makes it unlikely that an existing TypeScript program can be compiled to WebAssembly without modifications, yet not so unlikely that an already reasonably strict TypeScript program can be made compatible with the AssemblyScript compiler.

But what does this mean _exactly_? Well, let there be...

## Differences

For a better understanding of what to expect, let's start with a collection of obviously "not so strictly typed" code snippets, and how to fix them.

### Strict typing

There is no `any` or `undefined` for obvious reasons:

```typescript
// üò¢
function foo(a?) {
  var b = a + 1;
  return b;
}

// üòä
function foo(a?: i32 = 0): i32 {
  var b = a + 1;
  return b;
}
```

There are no union types:

```typescript
// üò¢
function foo(a: i32 | string): void {
}

// üòä
function foo<T>(a: T): void {
}
```

Objects must be strictly typed as well:

```typescript
// üò¢
var a = {};
a.prop = "hello world";

// üòä
var a = new Map<string,string>();
a.set("prop", "hello world");

// üòè
class A {
  constructor(public prop: string) {}
}
var a = new A("hello. world");
```

### The case of ===

AssemblyScript uses `===` for identity comparisons \(means: the exact same object\). Idea is that its special JavaScript semantics for strings \(same type and value\) become irrelevant in a strict type context anyway. Some like this better, some hate it for portability reasons.

```typescript
var s1 = "1";
var s2 = "123".substring(0, 1);
s1 === s1 // true
s1 === s2 // false
s2 === s2 // true
s1 === 1 // compile error
s1 == s2 // true
```

For all other types than `string` and operator-overloaded objects with a `==` overload, `===` is equivalent to `==`.

```typescript
1 === 1 // true
1 == 1 // true
obj === obj // true
obj == obj // true if there is no == overload doing something different
```

### Imports

With [WebAssembly ES Module Integration](https://github.com/WebAssembly/esm-integration) still in the pipeline, imports utilize the ambient context currently. For example

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="env.ts" %}
```typescript
export declare function doSomething(foo: i32): void;
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

creates an import of a function named `doSomething` within the `env` module, because that's the name of the file it lives is. It is also possible to use namespaces:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="foo.ts" %}
```typescript
declare namespace console {
  export function logi(i: i32): void;
  export function logf(f: f64): void;
}
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

This will import the functions `console.logi` and `console.logf` within the `foo` module. Bonus: Don't forget `export`ing namespace members if you'd like to call them from outside the namespace.

Where automatic naming is not sufficient, the `@external` decorator can be used to give an element another external name:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="bar.ts" %}
```typescript
@external("doSomethingElse")
export declare function doSomething(foo: i32): void;
// imports bar.doSomethingElse as doSomething

@external("foo", "baz")
export declare function doSomething(foo: i32): void;
// imports foo.baz as doSomething
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

### Conclusion

Even when considering that there are other [technical limitations](limitations.md) currently, this still means that it is pretty much possible already to create working programs on top of [WebAssembly types](types.md) making use of the provided [environment](environment.md), but it is not as easy as just compiling existing code with another compiler.
