# The Basics

WebAssembly is fundamentally different from JavaScript, ultimately enabling entirely new use cases not only on the web. Consequently, AssemblyScript is much more similar to a static compiler than it is to a JavaScript VM. One can think of it as if TypeScript and C had a somewhat special child.

## Strictness

Unlike TypeScript, which targets a JavaScript environment with all of its dynamic features, AssemblyScript targets WebAssembly with all of its static guarantees, hence intentionally **avoids the dynamicness of JavaScript** where it cannot be compiled ahead of time _efficiently_.

Limiting ourselves to where WebAssembly excels, for example by assigning or inferring definite types, eliminates the need to ship a JIT doing the heavy lifting at runtime, yielding **predictable performance** right from the start of execution while guaranteeing that the resulting WebAssembly **modules are small**.

## Static typing

The first peculiarity one is going to notice when writing AssemblyScript is that its [basic types](types.md) are a bit different from TypeScript's in that it uses WebAssembly's **more specific integer and floating point types**, with JavaScript's `number` merely an alias of WebAssembly's `f64`.

A JavaScript JIT would try to figure out the best representation of a numeric value while the code is executing, making assumptions as values flow around, potentially recompiling code multiple times, while AssemblyScript lets the developer **specify the ideal type in advance** with all its pros and cons. To give a few examples:

### No any or undefined

{% code title="" %}
```typescript
// ðŸ˜¢
function foo(a?) {
  var b = a + 1
  return b
}

// ðŸ˜Š
function foo(a: i32 = 0): i32 {
  var b = a + 1
  return b
}
```
{% endcode %}

### No union types

{% code title="" %}
```typescript
// ðŸ˜¢
function foo(a: i32 | string): void {
}

// ðŸ˜Š
function foo<T>(a: T): void {
}
```
{% endcode %}

### Strictly typed objects

{% code title="" %}
```typescript
// ðŸ˜¢
var a = {}
a.prop = "hello world"

// ðŸ˜Š
var a = new Map<string,string>()
a.set("prop", "hello world")

// ðŸ˜Š
class A {
  constructor(public prop: string) {}
}
var a = new A("hello world")
```
{% endcode %}

## Sandbox

WebAssembly modules execute in a sandbox, providing **strong security guarantees** for all sorts of use cases not necessarily limited to the browser. As such, a module has **no immediate access to the DOM** or other external APIs out of the box, making it necessary to translate and exchange data either through the module's [exports and imports](exports-and-imports.md) or reading from respectively writing to the module's linear memory.

## Low-level

Currently, values WebAssembly can exchange out of the box are **limited to basic numeric values**, and one can think of objects as a clever composition of basic values stored in linear memory. As such, whole **objects cannot yet flow in and out of WebAssembly** natively, making it necessary to translate between their representations in WebAssembly memory and JavaScript objects. This is typically the first real bummer one is going to run into.

For now, there is [the loader](loader.md) that provides the utility necessary to exchange strings and arrays for example, but it is somewhat edgy on its own due to its garbage collection primitives. It's a great starting point however for learning more about how the higher level structures _actually_ work.

In the near to distant future, the [reference types](https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-types) ðŸ¦„, [interface types](https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types) ðŸ¦„ and ultimately [GC](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc) ðŸ¦„ proposals will make much of this a lot easier and will allow us to implement [currently limited language features](limitations.md) more easily.

## Diverging semantics

Overall, there are a few differences that make it **unlikely that existing TypeScript code can be compiled** to WebAssembly without modifications, yet likely that already **reasonably strict TypeScript code can be made compatible** with the AssemblyScript compiler.

One prominent and admittedly controversial example of a semantic difference is that `===` performs an identity comparison \(the exact same object\) since part of its special JavaScript semantics \(same value and _same type_\) are irrelevant in a strict type context.

```typescript
var s1 = "1"
var s2 = "123".substring(0, 1)
s1 === s1 // true
s1 === s2 // false
s2 === s2 // true
s1 === 1 // compile error
s1 == s2 // true
```

For all other types than `string` and operator-overloaded objects with a `==` overload, `===` is equivalent to `==`. This is likely to change once we figure out a better alternative.
